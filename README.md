# Orizon API Node JS:

API built from scratch with Node.js and Express for the travel agency Orizon.

## :bulb: How it works

The API ha three data Schemas:
- Users: data of the subscripted users
- Products: data of the products
- Orders: data on which users and which
  products they have inserted in the specific order
 
Using the correct ENDPOINTS you can Create, Read, Update or Delete (CRUD) what do you
want. Finally, you can search through the intervals with some queries. For this project
where used Node.js (with Express framework) and MongoDB database.
